# Debugging Tips

## 1. Problem: Incorrect or Missing Dependencies
### Symptom:
- Errors like `Module not found` or `Cannot find module 'xyz'`.

### Solution:
- Check if all dependencies are installed:
    ```bash
    yarn install  # Or npm install
    ```
- If you recently added a new dependency, ensure it's correctly listed in the `package.json` file.
- Run the following command to check for any missing or outdated packages:
    ```bash
    yarn check  # Or npm outdated
    ```

## 2. Problem: Code Not Updating After Changes
### Symptom:
- Changes in the code don't reflect in the browser or development server.

### Solution:
- Try clearing the cache by running:
    ```bash
    yarn cache clean  # Or npm cache clean --force
    ```
- Restart the development server:
    ```bash
    yarn run dev  # Or npm run dev
    ```
- If using a build tool (e.g., Webpack), make sure the hot-reloading is working.

## 3. Problem: Console Errors or Warnings
### Symptom:
- Errors or warnings in the browser console related to JavaScript or React components.

### Solution:
- **Check error stack trace**: The stack trace in the console usually provides a clue about where the issue is in your code.
- **React-specific errors**: If you're getting React-specific errors, check the [React DevTools](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-react-devtools.html) for additional insights.
- **Check for deprecated methods**: Review any warnings about deprecated methods or props and update them as per the latest documentation.

## 4. Problem: Network or API Errors
### Symptom:
- Issues with making API requests, e.g., `404 Not Found`, `500 Internal Server Error`, or slow response times.

### Solution:
- **Check the API endpoint**: Ensure that the correct URL is being used.
- **Use DevTools**: Open the browser's Developer Tools and navigate to the Network tab to inspect the request/response. This will help debug any issues with the API calls.
- **Check your API Key**: Ensure that the correct API key is being used for the environment (e.g., sandbox or production). Refer to the API Key section in the [Common Issues](#common-issues-and-solutions) documentation.

## 5. Problem: Slow Performance
### Symptom:
- Slow load times, lag, or poor performance in the app.

### Solution:
- **Check for unnecessary re-renders**: Use React's `React DevTools` to check for unnecessary re-renders.
- **Use memoization**: Apply `useMemo` or `useCallback` in functional components to avoid recalculating values or functions unnecessarily.
- **Check network speed**: Use the Network tab in browser DevTools to see if large assets are slowing down the load time. Optimize images and assets where possible.

## 6. Problem: CORS Errors
### Symptom:
- Errors like `CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present`.

### Solution:
- **Enable CORS on the server**: Ensure that the API server has the necessary CORS headers set. For example, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` should be included in the response headers.
- **Proxy during development**: If you’re working locally, set up a proxy to avoid CORS issues while making requests to the backend:
    ```json
    "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"  # Add this in your package.json
    ```

## 7. Problem: Authentication Issues
### Symptom:
- Errors like `Invalid credentials`, `Unable to authenticate`, or `Session expired`.

### Solution:
- **Check credentials**: Ensure that your API credentials or OAuth tokens are correctly set.
- **Clear cookies**: If using cookies for authentication, clear the cookies and try again.
- **Check authentication flow**: Double-check the logic for handling user authentication, and ensure tokens are stored and sent correctly.

## 8. Problem: Styling and Layout Issues
### Symptom:
- Issues like misaligned elements, broken layouts, or missing styles.

### Solution:
- **Check CSS files**: Ensure that your stylesheets are correctly imported.
- **Inspect the element**: Use the browser’s Developer Tools (right-click -> Inspect) to see if styles are being applied correctly.
- **Check CSS specificity**: Sometimes styles are overridden by more specific selectors. Try increasing the specificity or using `!important` if necessary.
- **Responsive design**: Use the “Responsive” tab in the browser's DevTools to test the layout on different screen sizes.
