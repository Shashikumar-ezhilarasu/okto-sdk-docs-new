Common Issues and Solutions
1. Problem: Installation Errors
Symptom:
Errors like yarn: command not found or npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE during installation.

Solution:

Ensure Node.js and Yarn are installed correctly:
```bash
    node -v
    yarn -v
```
If not, install them:\
[Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)\
[Install Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable)

Additional Tips:
    Use the latest LTS version of Node.js for compatibility.
    If using a proxy, configure it correctly:
    ```bash
        yarn config set proxy http://your-proxy:port
    ```
2. Problem: Development Server Fails to Start
Symptom:
Running yarn run dev throws errors like Port 3000 already in use or crashes.

Solution:

Check if another process is using the port:
```bash
    lsof -i :3000  # On Linux/macOS
    netstat -ano | findstr :3000  # On Windows
```
Kill the process using the port:
```bash
    kill -9 <PID>  # On Linux/macOS
    taskkill /PID <PID> /F  # On Windows
```
Alternatively, specify a different port:
```bash
    yarn run dev --port 4000
```

3. Problem: API Key Issues
Symptom:
Errors like Invalid API Key or API Key is missing.

Solution:

Double-check that the API key is correctly set:
```bash
    const OKTO_CLIENT_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
```
Ensure the key matches the environment (e.g., Sandbox or Production).
Avoid committing API keys to version control. Use .env files:
```bash
    REACT_APP_OKTO_API_KEY=your_key_here
```
4. Problem: Styling or Layout Issues
Symptom:
The website looks broken or CSS styles don't apply.

Solution:

Verify that all dependencies are installed correctly:
```bash
    yarn install
```
Check for conflicting CSS imports in your project.
Clear the browser cache or force refresh:
    Windows: Ctrl + F5
    macOS: Cmd + Shift + R

5. Problem: Issues During PR Submission
Symptom:
PR rejected due to formatting or failing tests.

Solution:

Run the linter and fix formatting issues:
```bash
    yarn lint --fix
```
Run tests locally to ensure everything passes:
```bash
    yarn test
```

Rebase your branch with the latest main branch:
```bash
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main
```

6. Problem: Local Changes Not Reflecting
Symptom:
Updates don't show up during development.

Solution:

Ensure the development server is running.
Restart the server:
```bash
    yarn run dev
```
Delete the .next folder and rebuild:
```bash 
    rm -rf .next
    yarn run dev
```
